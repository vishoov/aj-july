Sceurity Threats


1. XSS
2. DB Injection Attacks
3. DDoS Attacks
4. Insecure databases
5. Server Security 
6. Broken Authentication


Security Best Practices 

1. Encryption -> encrypt any sensitive information, so that even if the database is compromised, the information is still secure

password ->9fgogf80te08pib;kfbidg08t08g

BCrypt -> npm i bcrypt

signup / login ->  encrypt   -> DB 


2. Rate Limiting 

Prevents DDoS Attack -> limit the number of requests that you allow the server to respond to in a given frame of time

npm i express-rate-limiter


3. Monitoring or logging 

help us create a record of the requests that we have recieved on our server and then we can have a record of these requests


if our server crashes so we can identify which was the last request that we received before the server crashed


4. API Authentication
