Aggregation pipelines consists of one or more stages that process documents sequentially (one after another)

database===1===2====3====4=====5====6===insight

NOTE!!!!!! -> Aggregation Pipelines DO NOT affect the data present in the database 

Each stage performs a specific operation on the input documents
group->filtering->projecting
and then passes the output data to next stage

The pipeline approach allows us to break down complex queries into manageable sequential Operations

USP:
1. sequential implementation -> one after another 
2. Document Transformation - stages can filter, group, reshape, modify the output
3. performance optimization -> database level implementation 

find() -> data -> server filter 

4. Flexible composition -> whatever stages i have i can combine them in any manner 

grouping filter 
filter group

syntax of aggregation

app.get("/analytics", async (req, res)=>{
    try{
        const result = await User.aggregate(
            [
                //implement multiple stages of aggregation 
                //inputs an array of objects 
                //where each object is an aggregation stage 
                //these will be implemented sequentially 
            ]
        )
    }
    catch(err){
        res.send(err.message)
    }
})

Core Aggregation Stages 

1. $match stage - filter the documents based on specific criteria (equivalent to find() query)


//find the users whos age is greater than 18 and their role is user 

const result = await User.aggregate(
    [
        {
            $match:{
                $and:[
                    {
                        age:{$gte:18}
                    },
                    {
                        role:"user"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
)


//A. find the users who have a valid age stored in the database 



//B. Find users whos age should be less than 50 

2. $group: groups the documents by spcecified fields and performs aggregation operation

i want to group the users by role 

user
admin
superadmin

{
    "user":count
},
{
    "admin":count
},
{
    "superadmin":count
}


//want to group users based on role -> user admin superadmin
//return the count of each category as well




3. Project -> reshape documents by inlcuding, excluding or transforming fields 

we are deciding how do we want to display the data 

$project:{
    name:1
    age:1
    email:1
    role:0
    password:0
    category:"$role"
}

$sort -> sorts the data on some value 
$limit -> we can limit the number of data that is being sent to us 
$skip -> skips starting n objects
