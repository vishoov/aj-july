MULTER


multer is a node.js middleware that helps us in uploading files to the server

Extra : this is built on busboy  -> to parse HTML data 

express.json() -> parse JSON




npm i multer 


RESTFUL -> keep the server as light as possible 

the more computation power we have -> the more users we can handle from the server 


1. import multer

2. Configure multer -> destination, default file names 
    DISK STORAGE CONFIGURATION


    1. Destination -> where the files need to be uploaded
    2. limits -> size limits Max allowed size
    3. FileType -> only allow certain types of files 
    4. FileNAme -> modify each file's name when uploading, suffix prefix 

to access the uploaded file -> req.file


req object that is provided to us by express 

req.body-> contains the text inputs from the forms -> json body
req.headers-> headers -> headers(technical details)
req.file -> single file 
req.files-> contains an ARRAY of uploaded files (in case of multiple uploads)
